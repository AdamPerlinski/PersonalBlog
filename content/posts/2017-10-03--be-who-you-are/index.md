I am really proud to announce, that I had succesfully launched a blog.

## What will you write about?

Topic will vary. Sometimes about politics, sometimes I will make programming guides. 

###  Who are you?

I am currently studying IT at the university in Szczecin and work as Software Developer in Szczecin and a hostess in Lubieszyn.
I am interested about anything really. So the content will vary. Also language will be mixed, as I am more comfortable in Polish.
